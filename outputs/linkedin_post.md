## POST OPTION 1: Short & Punchy (Recommended)

```
Just completed a comprehensive analysis of the Digital Divide across 3,100+ U.S. counties.

The findings were eye-opening:

📊 FCC reports 100% broadband coverage
📉 Reality: 12.4% of counties have speeds BELOW 25 Mbps

One county in Nebraska has "100% coverage" but actual speeds of just 0.4 Mbps.

Rural America is 6x more likely to lack adequate internet access than metro areas.

This matters because in 2024, internet access = access to:
→ Education
→ Healthcare (telehealth)
→ Job opportunities
→ Government services

Built with: R, spatial analysis, machine learning
Data: FCC, Ookla Speedtest, CDC Social Vulnerability Index, Census Bureau

The full analysis, code, and interactive visualizations are on GitHub.

## POST OPTION 2: Story-Driven (More Engagement)

```
"You have 100% broadband coverage."

That's what the FCC says about Keya Paha County, Nebraska.

The reality? Residents there get 0.4 Mbps.

That's not a typo. Zero point four.

I spent weeks analyzing broadband access across every U.S. county to understand the Digital Divide, and what I found challenges everything we think we know about internet access in America.

Key discoveries:

1️⃣ THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM
FCC data dramatically overstates coverage. Their definition of "available" doesn't mean "actually works."

2️⃣ THE RURAL PENALTY
Remote rural counties are 6x more likely to have inadequate internet. Not 6% more. Six TIMES more.

3️⃣ THE HIDDEN URBAN CRISIS
While rates are better in cities, the absolute numbers are staggering. Los Angeles alone has more underserved residents than entire rural states.

4️⃣ THE DOUBLE BURDEN
The most socially vulnerable communities also have the worst internet. Poverty + poor connectivity = compounded disadvantage.

Why does this matter?

Because we're making billion-dollar policy decisions based on flawed data. The $42B BEAD program is about to allocate funding based on FCC maps that don't reflect reality.

Tech used: R, sf, spdep, tidyverse, machine learning
Data: 6 sources including FCC, Ookla, CDC, Census

Full analysis and code available on GitHub (link in comments).

What's the internet situation like where you live?

## POST OPTION 3: Professional/Technical Focus

```
New Project: Analyzing America's Digital Divide with Data Science

I built a comprehensive analytical framework to identify which U.S. counties need broadband investment most urgently.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵:
• Integrated 6 data sources (FCC, Ookla, CDC SVI, Census, Microsoft Airband, USDA)
• Analyzed 3,120 counties with 30+ variables each
• Applied spatial regression, clustering, and ML classification
• Created a Composite Digital Vulnerability Index (CDVI)

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀:
• FCC availability ≠ actual performance (12.4% of counties below 25 Mbps threshold)
• Strong spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I ≈ 0.53) - regional approaches needed
• SVI is the strongest predictor of digital vulnerability
• Rural areas face 6x higher risk of inadequate broadband

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:
R | tidyverse | sf | spdep | spatialreg | caret | xgboost | ggplot2

𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀:
✓ Priority ranking for all 3,100+ counties
✓ Policy simulation comparing allocation strategies
✓ Interactive visualizations and choropleth maps
✓ Reproducible R Markdown pipeline

Open to discussions on broadband policy, spatial data science, or public interest tech.

## CAROUSEL/DOCUMENT POST (High Engagement Format)

### Slide 1 (Cover)
```
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE
IN AMERICA

What 3,100 Counties Taught Me
About Internet Inequality

[Data Science Project]
```

### Slide 2
```
THE PROBLEM

100% of Americans have
broadband access.

At least, that's what the
FCC reports say.

But is it true?
```

### Slide 3
```
I ANALYZED EVERY U.S. COUNTY

📊 3,120 counties
📁 6 data sources
📈 30+ variables
🔬 Spatial + ML analysis
```

### Slide 4
```
FINDING #1:
THE FCC IS WRONG

Keya Paha County, Nebraska
• FCC: "100% coverage"
• Reality: 0.4 Mbps

That's 62x SLOWER than
the minimum standard.
```

### Slide 5
```
FINDING #2:
RURAL = LEFT BEHIND

Remote rural areas are
6x MORE LIKELY
to lack adequate internet.

Metro: 3.9% underserved
Rural: 25.1% underserved
```

### Slide 6
```
FINDING #3:
VULNERABILITY COMPOUNDS

High poverty areas have:
• Worse infrastructure
• Lower adoption rates
• Less digital literacy

The gap widens.
```

### Slide 7
```
WHY THIS MATTERS

Internet access in 2024 means:
→ Education
→ Jobs
→ Healthcare
→ Government services
→ Opportunity

No internet = Left behind
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```
